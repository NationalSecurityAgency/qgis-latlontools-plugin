about=When working with Google Earth, Google Maps or other on-line mapping tools, coordinates are specified in the order of 'Latitude, Longitude'. Lat Lon Tools uses the standard Google Map format or a format as specified in "Settings". The plugin has three tools. The first captures coordinates to the clipboard when the user clicks on the map. The second takes decimal, DMS, or MGRS formatted coordinates, zooms to the point and highlights the location. The 3rd creates a list of points for rapid zooming. Lat Lon Tools makes it possibly to seamlessly copy and paste between QGIS, Google Earth, and other on-line maps. All tools work with latitude and longitude coordinates regardless of the QGIS project coordinate reference system. In Settings the user can choose the delimiter used between coordinates. The user can choose whether the capture format is in decimal degrees, DMS coordinates, native CRS, or MGRS coordinates. The user can also specify the coordinate order of 'Longitude, Latitude' in Settings.
